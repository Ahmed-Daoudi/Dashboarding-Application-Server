# Dashboarding Application Server

This repository contains the backend server for the **Dashboarding Application**, built using **Node.js**. It serves as the foundation for the web application, responsible for managing API requests, handling user authentication, and providing necessary data to the frontend. The server interacts seamlessly with the **BI Dashboards** and ensures efficient data flow to the React-based frontend.

### Key Features:
- Handles API requests and authentication.
- Connects to the database to fetch and serve data to the frontend.
- Integrates with **Power BI** to visualize data insights.
